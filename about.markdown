# About Colloquy

Colloquy is an open source library that provides a clean, consistent interface for interacting with different chatbot APIs. It simplifies building applications with large language models by abstracting away the complexity of directly working with vendor-specific implementations.

## Project Goals

Colloquy was created with several core goals:

- **Unified API**: Provide a single, consistent interface for multiple chatbot providers (currently OpenAI and Claude)
- **Simplified Function Calling**: Make it easier to let chatbots call your code functions with proper type support
- **Developer Experience**: Reduce boilerplate and complexity when building LLM-powered applications

## Key Features

- **Provider Agnostic**: Write code once that works with any supported LLM backend
- **Seamless Function Integration**: Let chatbots call your application functions with minimal configuration
- **Conversation Management**: Automatically tracks conversation history for contextual interactions
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add custom bot implementations and extend functionality
